# ___0x03.Unittests and Integration Tests___
This folder contains my submissions for the tasks in the project named ___[0x03.UNITTESTS AND INTEGRATION TESTS](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/1237).___ The project was an introduction to code testing in Python through unittests and integration tests.

## Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Python packages/frameworks:

   i. [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html): Unit testing framework

   ii. [parameterized](https://pypi.org/project/parameterized/): Structured parameterized testing in Python

## Mandatory Tasks
There are nine mandatory tasks in this project, comprised of two python scripts (*.py). The first four build the test cases in [test_utils.py](test_utils.py), while the last four build on the ones in [test_client.py](test_client.py)

## Advanced Tasks
There is just one advanced task in this project, which is a python script named [test_fixtures.py](test_fixtures.py).
